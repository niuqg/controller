Cisco Systems, Inc. wishes to acknowledge the seminal and leading work of David Erickson.
David's implementation of Beacon was one of the first open-source network controllers.
The OpenDaylight Project would not exist were it not for David's intellectual and 
architectural contribution and his inspiration lives on in the OpenDaylight code base today.
